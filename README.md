  Welcome to the Gloucestershire College 2021-2022 HNC programming repository!
</b></p>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**WHAT IS THIS FOR?**

The purpose of this repository is to act as a central hub for us to upload and share our code; the goal being that we are able to help eachother gain a greater understanding of programming techniques so that we can breeze through the units which require some form of programming.

To make use of this repository, go to the respective folder for the programming language you'd like to learn more about e.g., Python and browse through the resources available.

Most work uploaded here will more than likely include comments to help you understand what certain functions are doing and their purpose in the program. By reading through the available resources, you should be able to understand how certain tasks are achieved in a programming language and as a result be able to implement them into your own work.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UPLOADING CODE/PROGRAMS**

When uploading your work, feel free to credit yourself either through comments in the code or through the title of the file and if possible try to upload it in the relevant programming language folder e.g. Python.

Wherever possible please try and make sure the code you upload is commented so that others are able to read through it and understand what is happening the code! We all program in different ways and some methods we use might not make complete sense to others without some form of explanation.

I will do my best to categorise any code uploaded here into their respective programming languages and what your code covers (such as classes, writing to files, etc.) so that the repository is easily navigatable to find exactly what you need.

**ISSUES WITH CODE**

If you have some code you are experiencing issues with and are unsure what is going wrong, you can make use of Github's "Issues" feature in this repository. This is perhaps not the way the feature was intended, but we can make the most out of it.

To upload a question, navigate to the 'Issues' tab in this repository as shown below:

Once at this page you should be greeted with a screen like the one in the image below. Click on the green 'New issue' and create your post.

Title your post with the issue you have and include which programming language your program is in within the content of the post. Be sure to also include the code itself where applicable to aid in the troubleshooting process.
Here is an example post:

(Note that you can properly format your code in the issues post by wrapping your code in two apostraphes (') like so:)

Once uploaded, others will be able to view your issue and help you if they are able to spot an issue within your code. Obviously take into account that we are all in the same boat, so some of us may not be able to help you with your issue. If Billy or Michael end up joining this repository, you could tag them into your issues post to see if they are able to give any response.

**ENDING MESSAGES** 

I hope you find this resource useful and are able to learn a thing or two from what is uploaded here.

As previously mentioned, I will do my best to maintain this repo when I have the time to keep it organised and make it easy for you to find the resources you're after.

If you have any issues with uploading or accessing anything in this repo, message me (Bradley) on Teams and I will try to help you where possible.
